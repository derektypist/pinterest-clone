# Pinterest Clone

The purpose of the project is to build functionality similar to  https://build-a-pinterest-clone.freecodecamp.rocks/.

## UX

As an unauthenticated user, I can login with GitHub.

As an authenticated user, I can link to images.

As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I have been linked to.

As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images that I have been linked to.

As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.

As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image (can use jQuery broken image detection).

Masonry.js is a library that allows for Pinterest-style grids.
